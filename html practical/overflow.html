        The manuscript presented in this book is an outcome of the experience gained in the teaching
            the courses like discrete mathematics, automata theory, and mathematical foundation of computer science at Department of Computer Science & Engineering at I E T, UP Technical University, Lucknow and elsewhere for last ten years. I am hopeful that presentation of this text
            imitates the planning of the lectures. I always tried to avoid the mathematical-rigors, complicated concepts and formalisms and presented them in a more precise and interesting manner.
            Moreover,
